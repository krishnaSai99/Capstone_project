# Insect Classification Capstone Project  

## Overview  
This project develops a **hybrid deep learning model** to classify insect species using the **IP102 dataset** with over 75,000 labeled images. The model integrates ResNet50 and VGG16 architectures to achieve a **state-of-the-art weighted accuracy of 78%**, advancing pest management and ecological monitoring.  

## Features  
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines ResNet50 and VGG16 for enhanced classification.  
- **Robust Data Processing**: Employs AugMix and Gaussian noise injection for handling noisy datasets.  
- **Hierarchical Classification**: Implements cascade training for granular insect categorization.  

## Objectives  
- Provide precise insect species identification to aid agricultural pest control.  
- Enhance model resilience for real-world noisy datasets.  

## How It Works  
1. Preprocesses data with resizing, cropping, normalization, and noise handling.  
2. Trains hybrid and cascade models on labeled datasets for hierarchical classification.  
3. Evaluate performance, achieving superior accuracy compared to standalone models.
